&lt;p&gt;The project on Tabidze street that has been designed by &quot;Spectrum&quot; was &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/hAYRcE7LNaw&quot;&gt;broadcasted&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; on TV program devoted to interior design. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the aim to reinterpret traditional design standards, the apartment features the intersection of spaces, surfaces and compositions that are functional and create a bespoke visual effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the main challenges of the planning process was to create an interior where all of the rooms would have access to the spectacular views of the greenery of &quot;Vake Park&quot; and benefit from ample sunlight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern minimalism is present in every single area of this luxury interior, where modern and traditional materials meet to create a bespoke environment, that delivers comfort.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

&lt;p&gt;Spectrum performed Green Facade construction works for Radisson Collection Tsinandali.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This made the hotel building the first Facade in Georgia fully covered in greenery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The green facade is the most striking element of the building it contributes to bringing nature into resort's landscape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When guests approach Radisson Collection Tsinandali, they may feel like diving into a nature through the green facade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Different species used on the facade contribute to biodiversity and a cleaner environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Volume of the building is covered by metal construction, on which the composition of planted elements is fixed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The green facade allows Radisson Hotel to absorb tons of CO2, scrubbing the air for healthier living conditions for both visitors of the hotel and the wider city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It reduces energy consumption: protects the building from harsh sunlight offering solutions for the serious urban problems.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>
