&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;A Comfortable Home&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comfort is the most important &quot;home decor trend&quot; at the moment, it is probably what we’re all longing for. We’ve been spending more time at home than ever before, not just for relaxing but we’ve also started working at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Big comfy sofas in comfortable fabrics (velvet is still a big design trend) are something that we’ll see a lot in the future and this new seating is often in bright colors like pink, mustard yellow and green.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://spectrum.ge/images/Blog/2021trends/1fc5f231-c31e-422f-a4ea-d1fa4bf764e9_rw_1920.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1172&quot; height=&quot;880&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;A Natural Look At Home&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've all been feeling a stronger connection to nature in the last year. Light-filled rooms with plants are gaining popularity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decorate your home with greenery, use window sills to grow herbs and add flower boxes to add a little to your home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also our furniture and home decor can add to that natural look with items made of natural materials such as wicker and rattan&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Natural elements such as terracotta vases, marble coffee tables, wicker baskets, and wooden furniture, all work together to add texture and warmth to a room, creating a more organic look that can produce a relaxed, calming vibe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we’re not only seeing green colors and natural materials in home decor but also more focus on sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A light color palette&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s always a challenge to approach your interior design’s color scheme in a holistic fashion. However, when it comes to small apartment design, your color palette should help you create an illusion of a bigger space. Generally, you should consider light colors such as white, off-whites, pastels, or muted colors for your apartment. These colors help create an open and expansive feeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pastel colors are colors that belong to the milky and desaturated family. These are colors that have enough white mixed in to offer a colorful yet soft look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://spectrum.ge/images/Blog/smallapartment/pastel_1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;837&quot; height=&quot;414&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tiny Apartment Layout Dos and Don’ts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laying out furniture in a tiny dorm or apartment can make or break the space because furniture often consume substantial space. Here are a few dos and don’ts when planning your furniture layout:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dos:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Do use multi-functional furniture pieces;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Do consider expandable/stackable tables that can be tucked away to save up space when not in use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Do consider customizing your furniture pieces for smaller dimensions because readily-available furniture pieces in the market usually have standard dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. Do create an open space layout. As much as possible, place larger pieces of furniture against the wall, even if sometimes that’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.froy.com/decorating-trends-to-avoid-8-common-interior-design-mistakes/&quot;&gt;bad interior design&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’ts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Don’t block pathways and walkways with furniture and accessories because if you do, you’ll create a cramped layout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Don’t visually display your stuff all throughout your space. If you own a lot of things, either declutter or develop an organizing system to hide them and to have a very sleek and clean interior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hang wall art or tapestry with simple designs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decorating small spaces with hanging wall art or &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.froy.com/tapestry-ideas-for-decorating-your-home/&quot;&gt;tapestry&lt;/a&gt; will give some personality to the space. Remember to pick ones that are simple and light in design as to not avoid overcomplicating walls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can choose to hang a single large piece or a combination of a few smaller pieces. Either way, art and wall hangings have the ability to elevate the visual interest of your small apartment above ground. This helps lift the focus away from the clutter of your floor and to the much cleaner walls. If the art piece or tapestry are simple enough in design, it can act almost like a window and expand visual space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://spectrum.ge/images/Blog/smallapartment/017e919dcbd5514798d7668ed5f92f8d.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;854&quot; height=&quot;851&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multi-purpose furniture&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Functionality is very crucial in decorating small spaces so consider using multi-purpose furniture pieces to save up space. You can use coffee tables with storage, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://froy.com/collections/futons-sofa-beds&quot;&gt;futon or sofa bed&lt;/a&gt; instead of a traditional couch to serve as extra sleeping bed for guests, and a convertible folding desk (or you can have a foldable desk in tall shelves so as to hide them when not in use). You can also use an ottoman or a pouf in lieu or traditional coffee table to both maximize space and provide some warm cushiness – ottomans also commonly come with included internal storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;taller and wider curtains&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curtains and draperies are often overlooked by many but this actually has a great impact in interior spaces. Instead of following the actual measurement of your windows, you should expand and lengthen the measurement of your curtains. By doing so, you provide more height to your small apartment and extend the visual space of your windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, if the ceiling height of your space is not high, you can do a floor to ceiling drapery. You can also make your windows appear wider by extending your curtain rod to at least about 300-400mm both sides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decorating small spaces is not really complicated. If you know how to play around with what you have, you don’t have to splurge so much. Just make this article your guide for small apartment decorating ideas and you’ll surely enjoy decorating!&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

&lt;p&gt;Minimalist interior design is very similar to modern interior design and involves using the bare essentials to create a simple and uncluttered space. It’s characterized by simplicity, clean lines, and a monochromatic palette with color used as an accent. It usually combines an open floor plan, lots of light, and functional furniture, and it focuses on the shape, color and texture of just a handful of essential elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://spectrum.ge/images/Blog/minimalistdesign/IN_27098014_0002.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;869&quot; height=&quot;489&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elements of minimalist design&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The minimalist approach uses only the essential elements: light, form and beautiful materials, usually in an &lt;strong&gt;open plan layout&lt;/strong&gt;, to create a sense of freedom and relaxation. There is no excessive ornamentation and decoration. Instead, the few details that are used are uncomplicated and blend harmoniously into the setting. This might be in the form of a single artwork adorning a living room wall, or a beautiful vase on top of the dining room table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Minimalist furniture&lt;/strong&gt; and accessories focus on functionality and practicality. Flat, smooth surfaces and strong, clean lines create bold statements that emphasize the essential nature of each item. You won't find highly patterned furnishings and accessories or highly detailed ornamentation. Instead, the focus is on the purity and simplicity of the shape and form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clear and clean benchtops and surfaces, bare walls with minimal artworks, and the elimination of clutter, including piles of papers and collections of knick-knacks are also essential to creating a minimalist space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://spectrum.ge/images/Blog/minimalistdesign/robert-brown-interior-design-portfolio-interiors-family-room-media-1501110849-9469113-1557866371.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;845&quot; height=&quot;634&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Challenges of Minimalist Design&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;The biggest challenge is to make a space look warm and welcoming&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minimalist spaces are instantly recognizable for their crisp, clean, clutter-free and monochromatic look. The de-cluttering of space helps to de-clutter the mind and to create a sense of visual calm. However, some minimalist designs do run the risk of feeling a little soulless. To avoid this, and to ensure your minimalist-designed space also has a welcoming feel, there are a few small touches you can make. Whether it’s a kitchen, bedroom or living space, here are some ways to add warmth and color to your minimalist rooms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When using a monochromatic color palette, a great way to bring warmth to the space is by incorporating different shades and mixing textures. For instance, the use of linen wallpaper and soft wool fabrics and rugs in the bedroom adds soothing warmth. In the bathroom, the texture and grain of tile patterns can add visual interest while still maintaining a neutral color palette, while wood accessories can soften stark, white or concrete elements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Textiles add texture and provide added dimension and warmth to a space. Drapery, bedding, cushions, and area rugs in varying textiles such as linen, wool, and cotton are just a few examples of how you can add warmth and comfort to a room while maintaining a &lt;strong&gt;minimalist style&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</summary>

&lt;p&gt;Inspired by advertising campaigns, billboards and television artists such as Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein and Richard Hamilton turned to mediocrity. As part of the so-called anti-art - the campaign, they released the banal images of famous actors and transformed into exciting new art form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pop art interior design style is very emotional and energetic, so it is particularly close to young people who are ready to live in perpetual motion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bright colorful interior exhibitions are made of plastic, synthetic fibers, functional objects of catchy form, repetitive accessories, posters, and inexpensive popular souvenirs such as the plush heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1.Identical items of different sizes are placed at different levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2.large print or photo on the glass with a recognizable image can be placed in the center of the space: portraits of religious figures or products (a portrait of Che Guevara or advertising of Coca-Cola in the bedroom above the headboard perfectly match the style preferences).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3.Carpets with the logo of a well-known company or expressly synthetic animal skins, wall tiles with the repeating and recognizable patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.Furniture – bright colors, with a catchy pattern, perhaps – with glossy surfaces or plastic.&lt;img src=&quot;https://spectrum.ge/images/Blog/popart/680d80d5-17f9-418c-89b6-801164c441811.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;747&quot; height=&quot;560&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The walls, ceiling, and floor do not carry background notional load visually, they may merge into one decoration conceived by the artist. The pop art style in the interior allows acid colors that blend with the white, contrasting items together at the same time. A sense of proportion is determined only by your ability for a long staying in such screaming scenery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1.Optimum division of the walls by color is when one wall remains cream or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.smalldesignideas.com/beige-color-interior-decoration-ideas-proper-combinations.html&quot;&gt;beige&lt;/a&gt;, and it accommodates the mirror of unusual shape or stylized print, the other two are painted in bright tones, but in tune with each other, the fourth – the one that includes a door or window – in simple ornamental technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2.The ceiling can be multileveled and asymmetrical with colorful lighting as well as to have a glossy plane surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3.The floor is the most neutral part of the composition. But you can possibly meet a bright carpet (or restrained color with a chaotic pattern) here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.The furniture amount is minimal. However, it has futuristic, unusual shape, squat, and deserving special reviewing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5.Accessories are plastic, chrome, but always of amusing form. For example, in the form of a female silhouette or comic book heroes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, there will be other elements at play, but getting the balance right within any room is important to how it will make you feel when you are in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Planning out your spaces can be easy if you understand the principles of applying balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is key to making a room look visually stable by the simple placement of furniture, accessories, the use of color and other elements such as form, and size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without it you will end up a room that feels, and looks uncomfortable to be in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are basically three different types of balance: &lt;strong&gt;Symmetry, Asymmetry&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Radial&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;Symmetrical Balance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Symmetrical balance is achieved when items are actually repeated or mirrored along a central axis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This type of balance is frequently seen in nature, our own bodies included.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Symmetry is common in interior design and can portray a feeling of stability, calmness and dignity; however, can also be seen as static, dull and unimaginative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Symmetry can be achieved through the use of pattern, arrangement of furniture, fixtures and millwork, and through the application of color&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://spectrum.ge/images/Blog/Balance/484bdd2eceb9bd3c7e3703d926982eb5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;177&quot; height=&quot;247&quot; /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;Asymmetrical Balance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asymmetrical balance relates very strongly to the visual weight of objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than repeating the same item within a space to achieve balance, in this case we are using different elements with a similar perceived weight to achieve balance on the opposing axis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As stated above, complex shapes often feel heavier and for that reason are commonly used to achieve asymmetrical balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asymmetrical interiors tend to feel more dynamic and less rigid because in these spaces a variety of objects types are working together to create balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This form of balance can be more difficult to achieve it often requires an “eye for design”.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://spectrum.ge/images/Blog/Balance/1907f964bc37139cf57d1ecb122fb76a.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;315&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;Radial Balance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as it sounds radial balance is almost circular – distributed arrangement of items around a central point either extending outward or inward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Common examples of radial balance translated to the interior environment include chairs centered around a table, the structure of a circular rotunda, or even a circular lighting fixture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you wish to create focus on a central item, applying radial balance (so that the your attention is directed inward) is a great way to achieve this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://spectrum.ge/images/Blog/Balance/499bcd5ee7ca17a5f937bf5179106e61.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;221&quot; height=&quot;271&quot; /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

&lt;p&gt;Rhythm is defined as recurrence, continuity or organized movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you repeat color, shapes, pattern, texture or complementary similar pieces through space, you create visual interest and rhythm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In interior design, there are five principles of rhythm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This includes radiation, contrast, transition, gradation, and repetition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;Radiation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Radiation is an element of rhythm in interior design when the features in the room are balanced and repeated around a center point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some examples include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Circular table with a vase of flowers and chairs radiating off the table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stairs going in circle around center point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding a circular pendant light on top of the table plus two circle prints on the wall emphasizes radiation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://spectrum.ge/images/Blog/Rythm/be5b150a9c8a73caa3a3f178b820cea7.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;343&quot; height=&quot;343&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000; font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;Contrast&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;Contrast is an&lt;/span&gt; element of rhythm that involves directly opposing colors and shapes. It can be found in many different ways. Below are some examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shapes&lt;/strong&gt; – curves in a chair compared to strong square lines on table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Colors&lt;/strong&gt; – Green and red, the opposite colors in color wheels, create contrast. The green in your garden against your red window shutters and door, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Styles&lt;/strong&gt; – Many dining rooms have plenty of traditional details of architecture already built-in. You can hang modern paintings to contrast old-fashioned interiors, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000; font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;Transition&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through the transition, rhythm leads the eyes gently and subtly into an uninterrupted, continuous flow from one spot in the room to the next. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;Transition is not as easy to define as the other principles. Unlike gradation or repetition, transitions tend to be a smooth flow, in which the eyes glide from one spot to another. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;Using a curvy line to lead the eye gently is the most common use of transition. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;Examples of this include rounded edges, winding paths or arched doorways. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000; font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;Gradation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;Another principle of rhythm is gradation. The size of the same room objects changes from large to small or from small to large, from light to dark or vice versa. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;This creates a nice rhythm drawing the eyes up and down the line of gradation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;This type of rhythm is taking different sized elements and decreasing or increasing one or more of its qualities. Varied sizes would be the most obvious implementation of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;Different sized candle clusters on a basic tray create a great interest due to its shown progression.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;You can also use color to achieve gradation such as a monochrome color scheme where every element is a shade slightly different from one hue. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://spectrum.ge/images/Blog/Rythm/991b7aa0f035bd86a5e9860197974438.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;267&quot; height=&quot;356&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000; font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;Repetition&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;Repetition is a principle of rhythm that is based on similar patterns, colors, textures, forms shapes and similar lines throughout your interiors. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;The technique of repetition gives the room a clear sense of cohesiveness and stability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;For instance, when the eyes follow a continuous movement along the halls by using repeating floor lights or upright posts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;When you repeat framed&lt;/span&gt; prints that are the same size, this is an effortless method of achieving a gentle, lovely rhythm. Repetition is using the same elements more than one time in space.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;This type of rhythm is taking different sized elements and decreasing or increasing one or more of its qualities. Varied sizes would be the most obvious implementation of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;Different sized candle clusters on a basic tray create a great interest due to its shown progression.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;You can also use color to achieve gradation such as a monochrome color scheme where every element is a shade slightly different from one hue. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://spectrum.ge/images/Blog/Rythm/991b7aa0f035bd86a5e9860197974438.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;267&quot; height=&quot;356&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000; font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;Repetition&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;Repetition is a principle of rhythm that is based on similar patterns, colors, textures, forms shapes and similar lines throughout your interiors. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;The technique of repetition gives the room a clear sense of cohesiveness and stability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;For instance, when the eyes follow a continuous movement along the halls by using repeating floor lights or upright posts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;When you repeat framed&lt;/span&gt; prints that are the same size, this is an effortless method of achieving a gentle, lovely rhythm. Repetition is using the same elements more than one time in space.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;Color psychology is a powerful interior design tool that impacts the mood of a room more so than any other factor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Different shades evoke certain emotions so, when choosing your colors, it’s important to consider the kind of atmosphere you wish to create and which colors will help you achieve this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you’re looking to add the odd pop of color or decorate your entire room, discover the psychological effect of color in interior design with our help:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;Blue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue is among the most calming colors in the palette for interior design. In regards to the psychological effects of color, blue relaxes the mind and slows down heart rate, metabolism, blood pressure, and hypertension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aquatic shades of blue, in particular, such as sky blue and light blue have a healing effect on the mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It reminds the inhabitants of the sea or swimming pools. You can use different shades of blue in all areas of the house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can use darker shades such as royal blue as primary colors and pair it with yellow and use it for the kitchen, playroom, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also use a combination of light and dark blue colors in the bedroom and dining room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although using blue in dark rooms with small spaces can create an eerie feeling like that of being trapped in ice, you can add a touch of warm colors to neutralize the effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;Black&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The color black has always fared well with versatility and elegance. Black signifies simplicity and functionality. This color works best in modern interior design and architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a psychological front, an all-black room can be overwhelming and gloomy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, if you pair the color with red, white, blue, or almost anything else, it provides excellent contrast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrary to popular belief, the color black is an excellent addition to interior design, especially in the kitchen, living room, dining area, and bathroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://spectrum.ge/images/Blog/unnamed.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;363&quot; height=&quot;253&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;Green&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When people see the color green, they think of nature. Although, in reality, nature can be cruel, the human psyche associates nature with freshness, peace, and trust. Thus, green is a powerful color in interior design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, pale green is promptly associated with the color of pea soup, which is comfort food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It helps relax the senses and lower the levels of hypertension and blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Green can be used in different shades throughout the house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can use lighter shades on the walls and create contrast with dark shades of green with plants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effect of the dark shade is neutralized as plants automatically remind people of nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The color green mostly has a calming effect with a sense of security, which makes it an ideal color for interior design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://spectrum.ge/images/Blog/colorpsychology/08be09e2371d3ec4a164bf60a6de1172.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;333&quot; height=&quot;340&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;Red&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Red is one of the more dramatic hues in the coloring book and one of the most enticing colors when it comes to rousing emotions. It’s often coupled with sentiments such as passion, excitement and energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ambition, action and will power are additional qualities attached to the primary hue and that’s why red can be a productive choice for home offices and creative spaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The color is not only powerful in its most basic form in interior design psychology, but also boasts many beautiful sister shades including tomato red, crimson and burgundy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you want to channel a rich, traditional aesthetic or a pop-art feel, red can provide a solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;Pink&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The color Pink influences emotions that are closer to the heart. When used appropriately, pink and all its shades create an atmosphere of love and compassion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although pink is largely associated with feminism, you can still use this color for a masculine effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simple patterns and sophisticated designs can take pink to a whole new level in modern interior design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It instigates feelings of comfort and love. Vibrant shades of pink such as Magenta, Fuchsia, etc. help make a statement when paired with secondary colors such as light blue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can use them to bring out the playfulness of wall patterns. Complement the color pink with natural hues or vibrant tones of red and white for form and function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It helps in preventing any sentiments of loss and excessive sweetness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pink is best used in the room color for teenage girls or in the living room and bathroom to create an atmosphere of joy and bliss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://spectrum.ge/images/Blog/colorpsychology/4c23b56b7e15d5b354c2d885b4a6d459.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;417&quot; height=&quot;417&quot; /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;Purple&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The color purple is usually associated with elegance and royalty. Purple color schemes work well in areas that inspire creativity and design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bright hues of purple such as violet or plum add flair to your design scheme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whereas, lighter shades of purple such as lavender and mauve create a calm but regal effect in your design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since purple inspires creativity, you can add it to dressing rooms, walk-in closets, in-house art studios, or even the kitchen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This color is particularly popular with adolescent teens as it inspires them towards creative and performing arts and helps them find their path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The regality of purple also works well in the foyer or living room where your guests spend time. It gives an essence of calm, elegance, and luxury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;Yellow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The color yellow is synonymous with sunshine, thereby spreading the effect of light and happiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow is also associated with intellect and prosperity, due to its close associations with the color gold. In interior design, the color yellow is recommended for the kitchen, dining areas, hallways, and bathrooms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The color automatically uplifts people’s spirits making the room feel bright and sunny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although most shades of yellow have a positive effect on the psyche, dull yellow colors instigate a feeling of doom, decay, and sickness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is best to use yellow in its bright shades around the house. Make sure to use it sparingly though, as yellow tends to stimulate uncontrollable emotions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the extreme optimistic effect, a completely yellow room can drive up blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brain associates high blood pressure with feelings of anger thus causing people to lose their temper without any provocation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://spectrum.ge/images/Blog/colorpsychology/59d9d065a29cefd26e753fd06a66b10c.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;357&quot; height=&quot;357&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;Orange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It symbolizes sunshine and nature. Orange and all its shades pretty much have a positive effect on the psyche.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Distant tones of Orange, such as gold represent wealth and prosperity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can either reflect on the client’s personality or their desire for success and fame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orange, much like red, also inspires desire, love, sexuality, and appetite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This color predominantly has a calming effect on the senses as it reminds people of laying on the beach, drinking tropical beverages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orange is typically best used in bedrooms with complimentary tints that tone down the extreme effects of the color.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also use it in exercise areas to stimulate people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orange can increase appetite, which is why it is well suited for indoor and outdoor kitchen areas.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

		<summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://spectrum.ge/images/Blog/16_11006_00_N164_high300.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond imagining how colors will look together and work in your home, it’s important to consider how they make you feel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Color psychology is the theory that colors can affect how you feel, think and act. Color can alter a person’s mood, incite anger, evoke happiness, or call to mind feelings of indifference and sadness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily, there are a few color rules that you can use to make sure your colors look balanced every time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;Warm vs. Cool Colors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, shades like red, orange and yellow are thought of as warm colors because they are more vibrant. However, neutrals like brown and tan are also included in the mix. On the other side of the spectrum are the cool colors, or blue, green and purple, as well as gray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The choice of warm or cool colors will affect the energy of the space. Since warm colors tend to bring an upbeat and welcoming feel to a room, they’re best in entertaining spaces. Think about using these shades in your dining room or kitchen. Cool colors, on the other hand, are more subdued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They work best in bedrooms and office spaces, where calming energy is appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://spectrum.ge/images/Blog/bcd88a02c5e88ce0db9d656d7daefc58.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;The 60-30-10 Rule&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;60-30-10 is a simple decorating rule to help you choose color schemes for your home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 60% main color of the room includes things like your walls, your sofa, the main color of your area rug, and perhaps even your cabinets or tile (if we’re talking about kitchens and bathrooms). If you squinted your eyes when you walked into the room, this would be the predominant color you would see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 30% secondary color includes things like accent chairs, bedding, drapery, an accent wall, and maybe even painted doors or furniture. The main purpose of the secondary color is to provide contrast. This color will show up about half as much as the main color in your space, so think of it like a great supporting actor in a film. It’s different enough from the main color to provide interest, but not steal the show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 10% accent color is the fun stuff – decorative accessories, pillows, artwork, lamps, picture frames, candles, florals… It’s the pop of color you want people to see in your room. Could even be a metallic finish, like gold or brass…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;The complementary color scheme&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of all the color rules that interior designers use, the complementary color scheme is often thought of as the simplest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s because this color scheme only involves two shades. In particular, it uses two shades that are sitting directly opposite each other on the color wheel, meaning you get combinations like blue and orange, yellow and purple or red and green.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see from the photo, these color pairings are extremely high contrast, which means that — while they undoubtedly bring strong energy into space — they’re ultimately best used in small doses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should think of them as your accent colors and use plenty of neutrals to balance them out and provide a place for the eye to rest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://spectrum.ge/images/Blog/dea4a877e17479d679790d166f45eafb.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;257&quot; height=&quot;190&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;The Analogous Color Scheme&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have trouble navigating the color wheel, an analogous color scheme might be for you. For this one, all you have to do is pick  a central color, then also use the colors on either side of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, two colors will be primary colors and the third will be a mix of the two. For example, red, orange and yellow or red, purple and blue. Since you’re using three colors in this one, proportion will come in handy to make sure the space feels balanced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may want to incorporate the 60-30-10 rule again to keep your proportions in check.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And remember, you can always use different shades of the same color as another way to create visual variety. Interestingly, if you’re not a big fan of vibrant hues, you can also do an analogous color scheme using neutrals. Typically, this is referred to as a monochromatic color scheme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://spectrum.ge/images/Blog/Analogous_Colors.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;232&quot; height=&quot;162&quot; /&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, color schemes are the most prominent component of home decor. It’s the colors that add beauty and sprinkle magic around your home. Ranging from bold to bright, you have an entire palette to experiment with.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://spectrum.ge/images/Blog/16_11006_00_N164_high300.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond imagining how colors will look together and work in your home, it’s important to consider how they make you feel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Color psychology is the theory that colors can affect how you feel, think and act. Color can alter a person’s mood, incite anger, evoke happiness, or call to mind feelings of indifference and sadness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily, there are a few color rules that you can use to make sure your colors look balanced every time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;Warm vs. Cool Colors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, shades like red, orange and yellow are thought of as warm colors because they are more vibrant. However, neutrals like brown and tan are also included in the mix. On the other side of the spectrum are the cool colors, or blue, green and purple, as well as gray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The choice of warm or cool colors will affect the energy of the space. Since warm colors tend to bring an upbeat and welcoming feel to a room, they’re best in entertaining spaces. Think about using these shades in your dining room or kitchen. Cool colors, on the other hand, are more subdued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They work best in bedrooms and office spaces, where calming energy is appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://spectrum.ge/images/Blog/bcd88a02c5e88ce0db9d656d7daefc58.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;The 60-30-10 Rule&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;60-30-10 is a simple decorating rule to help you choose color schemes for your home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 60% main color of the room includes things like your walls, your sofa, the main color of your area rug, and perhaps even your cabinets or tile (if we’re talking about kitchens and bathrooms). If you squinted your eyes when you walked into the room, this would be the predominant color you would see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 30% secondary color includes things like accent chairs, bedding, drapery, an accent wall, and maybe even painted doors or furniture. The main purpose of the secondary color is to provide contrast. This color will show up about half as much as the main color in your space, so think of it like a great supporting actor in a film. It’s different enough from the main color to provide interest, but not steal the show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 10% accent color is the fun stuff – decorative accessories, pillows, artwork, lamps, picture frames, candles, florals… It’s the pop of color you want people to see in your room. Could even be a metallic finish, like gold or brass…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;The complementary color scheme&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of all the color rules that interior designers use, the complementary color scheme is often thought of as the simplest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s because this color scheme only involves two shades. In particular, it uses two shades that are sitting directly opposite each other on the color wheel, meaning you get combinations like blue and orange, yellow and purple or red and green.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see from the photo, these color pairings are extremely high contrast, which means that — while they undoubtedly bring strong energy into space — they’re ultimately best used in small doses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should think of them as your accent colors and use plenty of neutrals to balance them out and provide a place for the eye to rest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;The Analogous Color Scheme&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have trouble navigating the color wheel, an analogous color scheme might be for you. For this one, all you have to do is pick  a central color, then also use the colors on either side of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The modern farmhouse style has its roots deep in centuries of history, back to the early settlers in the US. It was focused on usefulness, dependent on available materials such as wood, iron, and steel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the core elements of farmhouse today are similar to their historic counterpart. However, there are important updates to the style which we will cover. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Farmhouse interior design is defined by practicality and comfort, relying on readily available materials and colors. Wood elements and white tones are indicative of farmhouse style. Timber was the easiest to come by, which is why there’s such an emphasis on wood elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another core aspect is that nothing must match perfectly. Where modern design is meticulous in matching the elements of a room in a minimalistic way, the farmhouse is distinctly different. Knickknacks, antiques, or pairing a vintage chair with a new sofa enhances the farmhouse interior style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The beauty is in the functionality, punctuated by tinges of personality and history. The farmhouse interior design has the main characteristics that you should follow&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;Colors &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Color-wise, it is similar to nautical decor, with mostly white and natural beige base colors. This color palette is helping to emphasize other interior elements such as furnishing and decoration. There are common colors in the interior that are used, like barn red, forest green and yellow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://spectrum.ge/images/Blog/Modern-farmhouse-interior-decor.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;Decoration &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For decoration you should use old elements. Tables and chairs decided in vintage style, few pieces of art and accessories. Matching styles and tones with each other give practicality and charm to the home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fireplace is a futile way to bring coziness to the interior. You can also use plants for decoration, which will add color to space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://spectrum.ge/images/Blog/decor.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;Materials&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organic and natural materials are the foundation for the modern farmhouse decor. furniture is also decided in light tones, characterized by distressed wood and upholstered linen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A mix of industrial metals is used for a kitchen and bathroom decor with a large farmhouse sink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://spectrum.ge/images/Blog/9b09d4df249ced01f809f1e1b2bbe5a7.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With an emphasis on a clean, inviting atmosphere, the farmhouse style is defined by simplicity and some callbacks to years and styles went by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that way, it creates a timeless look. Last but not least, before you start your farmhouse remodel journey you need to choose if you prefer a traditional farmhouse (more similar to a country-style) or a modern farmhouse, that mixes country and modern elements achieving an overall more modern look.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Environmentally sustainable interior design (ESID) has become a major issue in interior design practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ecological factors play a major role in sustainable development. It is important that resources which humans produce through their hard work are not wasted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how can we combine customers' preferences and energy efficiency when designing interior? How to make our living environment more energy efficient?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what are the interior design styles that easily support ecological factors?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s discuss some design styles that focus on eco-friendliness:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;Industrial Style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike other interior designs, industrial design is natural and free. Such interior arrangement is profitable for the economic and ecological conditions in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the main characteristics of industrial style is exposing such architectural features that other designs ignore. For intense beams, columns, etc. Usually, even technical elements like wirings are in the center of attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first instance, it is possible to create glamorous and extraordinary visuals, and in the second instance, you do not need to waste your finances on purchasing new materials for cladding, the producing of which obviously brings a lot of damage to the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The industrial style concentrates on consuming as many natural factors as possible. This is why it is often associated with big and wide windows and open spaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The natural light that comes inside through the windows fills and lightens up the inner area, while open corridors help rearrange the incoming light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A common element you see in interiors is metal, wood and fabric furniture. Extraction and production of which takes a lot of ecological resources. In industrial interiors, it is frequent to use secondary or recycled furniture that is directly linked to eco-friendliness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, an integral part of the industrial interior is plants! Plants, of course, clean and freshen our air, on top of that they give nice ambiance to space. So, it is highly recommended to use as much plant for your interior as possible!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://spectrum.ge/images/Blog/industriuli-aveji.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;589&quot; height=&quot;424&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;Scandinavian Style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Scandinavian style focuses directly on sustainability. Eco-friendliness is a big focus here. It is the strict northern climate that defined the main characteristics of this style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like the industrial design, free space and organic materials are major spotlights here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Scandinavian design pays tribute to natural forms of the surroundings. To connect outdoor and indoor environments there are often live plants integrated into the inner space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Light-colored wood is often used in the Scandinavian interiors in its original form, without extra preparation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to save electricity, it is common to paint walls in light and bleached colors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bright coloring of the walls helps reflect the incoming sunlight that comes through big, wide windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus we consume much less electricity than usual. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://spectrum.ge/images/Blog/skandinaviuri-3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;608&quot; height=&quot;403&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, these styles may not match your taste, but at least, you can use the principles and details that make the interior way more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some of the recommendations to make your indoor environment more ecologically friendly are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+&lt;/strong&gt; Use light colors wall covering&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;+&lt;/strong&gt; Use organic and natural materials&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;+&lt;/strong&gt; Big windows are a &quot;must&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;+&lt;/strong&gt; Use recycled and secondary furnishing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;+&lt;/strong&gt; Place as many plants as possible.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>
