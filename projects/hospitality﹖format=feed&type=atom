&lt;p&gt;The added volume carefully responds to the streetscape and urban realm, with strong aesthetics responding to the wider city context. All the ornaments used on the historical facade will be fully restored and maintain an existing aesthetic value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stepping into the hotel the visitor is immediately enveloped by a sense of privacy and calm. Every element of the experience has been considered and crafted to exceed the highest expectations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The design approach has been to make extensive use of natural and classical materials, with contemporary detailing to create a balance of old and new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;Interior&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most interesting feature of the interior design is a partially open atrium, in the center of the first floor, which serves as an inner garden and at the same time as a breakfast area for Hotel guests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interior flows seamlessly to the exterior, converting the character into curved forms and uninterrupted sky glazing. The atrium is covered with metal and glass structure, with unique wavy aesthetics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The innovative use of the roof structure makes the place comfortable to spend time in any weather conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intelligent planning opens out space and lets the daylight flood in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, the interior is designed with a classic sophisticated palette of materials executed with the finest contemporary details to blend design and practicality. Contemporary creativity is set against a backdrop of classical riches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The keynote for the design is contemporary opulence: respect for traditional craftsmanship and high-quality materials, allied with a modern urban sensibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hotel offers exclusive facilities to its visitors to enjoy the ultimate in five-star luxury living. Hyatt Rustaveli includes a stunning pool with a terrace, gym and other spa facilities, where the guest can relax and get away from the urban routine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea of having new structure disappear in the historical Chavchavadze garden was generated from the notation of not adding a new element to the garden, but rather creating the extension of the natural environment formed with a new green layer that surrounds the entire structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within the surrounding historical context, the idea of making the new building disappear was conveyed by screening the entire building in a seamless array of natural plantations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The green facade is the most striking element of the building as it contributes to bringing nature into the resort's landscape. The green facade allows Radisson Hotel to reach far healthier living conditions for both visitors of the hotel and the wider surrounding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It further reduces energy consumption and protects the building from harsh sunlight during the summer.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

&lt;p&gt;The goal of the project was to create an organic, multi-functional complex that is binary with the environment. The architecture of the building takes into account the local context and characteristics. Its proportion and geometric forms naturally merge with the system terrain, repeating and emphasizing the contours of the local landscape. Various organic forms, materials and color palette harmoniously blend with the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;Context&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project is distinguished by the location. Green Cape is one of the most beautiful seaside resorts in Georgia. Batumi Botanical Garden is one of the most cultivated in Europe. The project are ais distinguished by its proximity to the sea. From the terrace there are breathtaking panoramic views of the sea and the botanical garden. Climatic conditions contribute to landscape planning. A wide variety of species are selected for patio terraces and rooftop gardens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;Functions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behind the building's original and attractive architecture is function and proper planning. The orientation, functional distribution and planning of the building takes into account the needs and interests of the residents. Three independent wings are united by a podium. A garden is planted with different functions. There is a restaurant, a bar and a swimming pool on the roof of the building.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

&lt;p&gt;The tower of the building is covered with cobblestone, while the horizontal and vertical brick inserts are used as details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Balconies and arches correspond to the proportions of the historic Kakhetian architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the windows, they are very accented and decorated with frames typical for the region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This facade represents the inspiration and commitment resulted from strong links between ethnicity and modernity, while it's design comes in line with the overall ambiance and designation of the hotel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By using traditional forms, this beautiful architectural structure becomes intelligible to the people of a particular place as well as for the guests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;Landscape&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Special attention was paid to the landscape design. Different varieties of trees were selected, both coniferous and deciduous. 25 X 6 m pool lined with classic elements is fully integrated into the architecture and connects to the hotel building by trails hidden in the green olive bushes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;Local inspiration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a model of locally-inspired design, which is full of local references and with balconies in antique style, the hotel will set out to shine a light on Kakheti’s rich history and build the region’s profile as an emerging travel hotspot.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

&lt;div&gt;The design methodology takes into consideration the characteristics of different guest types and delivers individual spaces, where each and every guest can Find a Home Away From Home! The welcoming and adaptable public spaces represent a free flow that seamlessly transforms into one another. While considering Canopy standards, each space is infused with contextual elements, neighborhood, cultural inspirations and local art. Carefully selected and designed furniture, accessories, textures and materials make ALL JUST FIT TOGETHER.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Character&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The location and surroundings drive design and environmental decisions. The lobby area full of ample sunlight, at night acts as a streetlamp giving out the energy and welcoming atmosphere. Carefully selected color pallets, materials and bespoke furniture create an atmosphere to define a positive stay! A sophisticated palette of natural materials creates a relaxing and soothing atmosphere, articulated by greenish folding doors with eyecatching colorful stained glass accents. The combination of brick, wood, colorful glass, blue velvet and greenish wood is set to create memorable and favorable space for gatherings.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;While most of the architectural elements of the old building are lost, in recognition of its history and to remind visitors that they are in the historical building, the feeling of the old facade was transmitted to the inner side of the facade wall and so that it resembles the old style of the original building. Based on the Latest Architecture of record, tried to find a balance between architectural solutions and material selection for the facade. With the aim to find practical solutions for balconies, roof deck, roof itself, the skylight, and the main entrance, we achieved a very sophisticated and refined appearance.&lt;/div&gt;</summary>

&lt;h5&gt;Design&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The design methodology takes into consideration the characteristics of different guest types and delivers individual spaces, where each and every guest can Find a Home Away From Home! The welcoming and adaptable public spaces represent a free flow that seamlessly transforms into one another. While considering Canopy standards, each space is infused with contextual elements, neighborhood, cultural inspirations and local art.

&lt;p&gt;The materials used in the interior design of the apartments of the project visually echo the exterior of the building. The main detail is the elegant combination of wood and metal. The tone of light colors of the rooms carries the character of the project, which perfectly fits the needs of any resident.
