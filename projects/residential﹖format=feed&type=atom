&lt;p&gt;The facade is balanced with a classic finish of wood combined with local textured limestone, that gives the house its modernistic, contextual feel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The oversized terrace encourages the occupants to step outside and enjoy the breathtaking views of Tbilisi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Innovative roofing technology is used at the terrace of the house, which electronically regulates the slanting angle of the sunlight and at the same time protects the terrace from the rain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project includes a stunning infinite pool directly situated on the first level of the yard, facing the beautiful view of nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main feature of the interiors is the natural material palette enriched with the display of the client’s extensive collection of art.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

&lt;p&gt;Views are utilized throughout the residence. Functions are distributed in a way to leave the space as a major feature while concentrating on practicality and usability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;Atrium&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preserving the existing tree and bringing nature inside is one of the interesting design elements the house features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The atrium allows for additional sunlight, while the natural element presents a biophilic approach, highlighting the intention of creating the “Urban Oasis”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;Basement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basement floor allocates showroom, Board room, office, lounge and wine cellar, in line with Man’s cave and cinema. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The showroom design, allocating 14 cars, is set as an expression of indulgence, passion, power, speed and unmatched extravagance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With dark tones as the main feature, decorative lighting is set to enhance the qualities of the prized possessions and showcase their audacious curves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A sense of minimalism surrounding the space complements the forms and allows to better reflect car aesthetics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The office, edge of lounge and terrace are exposed to mesmerizing caustics that is reflected from the glass flooring of the pool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This itself will become an interesting feature to observe throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;Ground Floor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ground floor allocates living space (living room, library, TV zone, Piano area and kitchen), VIP Guestroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Entertainment area (Terrace with pool, Gym, Spa, Sauna, BBQ) and BOH.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The living area creates flowing, airy open space with different arrangements of living area, TV area, library with ladder, dining area and dedicated piano area that can be observed from the living room extending the sweeping view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Massive terrace overlooking mesmerizing views eliminates line between indoors and outdoors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With comfortable arrangements of furniture and sunken lounge, it promotes spending maximum time outdoors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To prevent cutting down the trees, an interesting detail of the project was developed, such as cut out slabs of terraces and roof, where existing pine trees were pinched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This idea makes building and nature an integral part of each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project facade is lined with high-quality wood material and travertine tiles, that further promotes border-free integration of architecture with the surrounding landscape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;Integration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project of the house outlines the synthesis between nature and interior in keeping with a trend of comfort and domesticity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The relationship between the room and the external landscape is especially evident with the large living-room glass wall with opening, which is located on the ground floor and connects to the terrace framing a view of the pinewood landscape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from the living room, the kitchen and the cabinet spaces are conveniently connected to the yard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reflective pool, located along the terrace, in front of the living room, emphasizes the aesthetics of the harmonious fusion of nature and living spaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;Energy Efficiency&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the design process of the project, special attention was paid to the correct orientation of the building, warming and selection of the right materials to achieve maximum energy efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

Towering at a height of 206 meters, the building houses luxurious penthouses on its top floor, offering an elevated living experience with unparalleled vistas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Podium&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The architectural structure of the complex is divided into two main parts: a vibrant green podium housing commercial facilities and three multi-story residential complexes. The podium features a refreshing green terrace and a captivating swimming pool, offering residents a serene oasis within the bustling city. One of the most remarkable and distinguishing aspects of the building is its green facade. Enveloped entirely by a natural covering, the podium bears both visual appeal and ecological significance. The green facade efficiently absorbs a substantial amount of CO2, reduces energy consumption, and contributes to a healthier environment. The diverse range of plant species used in its creation fosters biodiversity and promotes environmental well-being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Striking Features&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to its captivating location and luxurious amenities,  Next Address boasts several striking features that set it apart. The sleek and modern architecture, characterized by its clean lines and geometric shapes, is a testament to contemporary design principles. The innovative façade design further enhances the building's visual appeal, making it a true architectural marvel in Batumi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The carefully crafted façade not only adds to the building's aesthetic charm but also serves functional purposes. It incorporates energy-efficient elements, contributing to the complex's sustainability goals and reducing the overall environmental impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the architectural design of the complex ensures seamless integration with the surrounding environment. Residents of the &quot;Next Address&quot; complex can truly enjoy the best of both worlds - a visually stunning architectural masterpiece and a comfortable, modern living space that caters to their every need.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

&lt;p&gt;The project’s concept brings elegance through simplicity as the exterior blends sleek lines with a neutral color palette. The plan has evolved through a series of functions after carefully considering the functionality and practicality of the villa. The project’s spaces were designed by changing the development strategy accordingly which enabled the creation of diverse spaces as per the user’s specific desires. The project’s design has been characterized by three distinct volumes, where one volume is cantilevered diagonally on the top which adds extra complexity to the structure. These masses are placed to create a unified look that is further spatially connected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Features&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exterior is made of vertical divisions of dark grey concrete that contrast smoothly with the tight rhythm of the timber cladding, which bring in warmth and sophistication. In addition, large glass windows are incorporated that beautifully overlook the Lake where natural light floods in. The solid surface cladding used brings a sense of privacy and safety to the house and also establishes interesting solid-void (light and shadow) encounters with daylight. Moreover, a metallic art sculpture has been installed over a tranquil waterbody that creates a captivating focal point on the villa front, facing the street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Facade&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The façade has been designed using alphabets and symbols from the Georgian language to bring in a connection to the cultural context of the region as well as create a sense of unique identity. The characters were placed in such a way that it creates a sense of rhythm and progression across the exterior. These metal perforated screens also visually obstruct the enclosed spaces toward the neighborhood. During the day, natural light rays enter into the house through the perforations and give rise to an interesting play of shadows; while artificial lighting pierces out during the night and hence makes the façade change dynamically during different times of the day.         &lt;/p&gt;</summary>

&lt;p&gt;The villa exterior is composed of vertically striped concrete cladding along with the presence of wooden louvers that not only control the amount of light entering the interior spaces, but also provide privacy to the occupants. The grey and brown color palette blends the project cohesively with the context and evokes a purist mentality. The floor-length glazing adds a modern touch along with providing magnificent views of the landscape. This transparency also lets the user experience the changes in weather, sun, and seasons from the internal spaces. The gabled roof is cladded with darker tiles than the concrete exterior, which also gives the viewer a sense of hierarchy on seeing the building. To top this off, a bright red metal sculpture is placed on a still and shallow water feature on the front which brings in a pop of color and exciting central viewpoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Features&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The villa is surrounded by thick landscaping that is carefully planned to add an extra layer of tranquility that gives a soothing and Zen-like effect. Also, the use of these plants not only enhance the visual appeal but also give a scented breeze from the flora as the winds flow through them. On the upper floor, a spacious living area opens up to a stunning infinity-like swimming pool with a glass wall on one face, providing unobstructed water views to users on the ground floor. This creates an effect that makes the pool appear as though it is floating in the air. The pool area that overlooks the greenery below, creates a serene oasis that is perfect to unwind after work or relax on weekends. Moreover, the villa features tapered windows on one of its elevations, to angle the window in such a direction that it opens the room to the optimal view of the surroundings.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

&lt;p&gt;We have challenged ourselves to create a private sanctuary that would connect to nature and let it become part of the residence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From visual &amp;amp; non-visual connection to nature, thermal variability, presence of water, dynamic &amp;amp; diffuse light, connection to the natural system, material connection to nature, biomorphic forms and patterns to complexity and order the design incorporates different patterns of biophilic design to achieve maximum comfort for residents, for their harmony and well-being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Natural materials are used throughout the design, both the façade and interior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second-floor design acknowledges both the importance of outdoor spaces and privacy by giving each bedroom its own separate balcony and allowing residents to retreat to their own corner or commune in the lounge area, which has a beautiful view of the patio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;The Patio&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most important details of this residential house project is the 50 sq. m patio, which is arranged on the South-East part of the house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A captivating patio design provides a modern home with a special sense of serenity and allows nature to become a major part of a home’s makeup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enclosed garden spaces act as personalized nature retreats that feed into adjacent interior spaces via the blurred boundaries of glass walls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The roof of the patio is made of steel structure and glass, providing constant sunlight and protection from the rain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;The Facade&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The facade is balanced with glass combined with stainless steel panels, which gives the house its modernistic, contextual feel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stainless steel panels change color according to climatic conditions, which makes the facade look different at different times.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>
