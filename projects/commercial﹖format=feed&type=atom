&lt;p&gt;The main concept of the new Headquarters of the National bank of Georgia project is the synthesis of its shape, aesthetics, ideology, and the function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ideology of the building is guided to its geometric shape of the circle, which is considered to be a continuous source of eternity and constant existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ideal shape of the circle is associated with sustainability and the analytical nature of the function of the National Bank, which is linked to the country's economic development and stability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The outer diameter of the circle is 60 meters while the inner diameter is 28 meters, which forms an internal atrium of the building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The glass skylight, what tops the atrium is represented by the National Bank’s logo, which once again highlights its direct connection to the function of the building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;Context&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In establishing the functional and architectural character of the project, the concept of determining energy efficiency criteria plays one of the main roles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept is presented with the system of solar panels, which leads to the extraction of a large amount of electricity by working of the heat pumps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 75% of the kinetic building's facade membrane is provided with stainless steel shutters, which are connected to lighting sensors and automatically open and close according to the sunlight intensity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The selection of the entire glazing system of the facade is based on sun position and relative U and G parameters of the glazing, proving maximum cooling and heating effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;Collaboration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The notion of collaboration flows into the layout and planning of each floor of the building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each level is conveniently connected via the ramp, along the atrium and provides a comfortable and ample solution for the internal circulation. Bespoke architectural layout fits the bank regulations including the custom-designed furniture is being considered. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the key elements of the building design is panoramic (smart) lift systems located in the atrium offering bank employees minimum waiting time and remarkable trip while enjoying atrium space filled with natural daylight and views.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The striking facade of the building is defined by an externally located three two-story atrium spaces revealing to the city an internal content and providing an external connection to the urban texture of the historical neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

&lt;p&gt;The center of the park’s projected area, both ideological and functional, is represented by the belvedere, which is a 33 meters high steel structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two elevators located in the center of the belvedere and the ramp along the structure is aimed for pedestrian visitors to reach the top of the building and enjoy stunning views of Kazbegi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also an ethnic restaurant for 80 people located on the top of the belvedere with panoramic views.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The facade of the structure is finished with metal panels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The belvedere offers unforgettable views of  Kazbegi to the visitors, allows it to become one of the top landmarks of the region, and attracts lots of tourists and vacationers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can become the funicular of Kazbegi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;Functions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The use of the park’s functions is available in all seasons. Building materials, types, and details of structures are specially tailored to Kazbegi's harsh climatic conditions. Of the proposed materials, specially treated stainless steel, processed wood material, natural stone, and concrete finishes should be highlighted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project site consists of various functional zones: A children’s playground, a reflecting pond, a restaurant with a terrace, a leisure area, an amphitheater, and a labyrinth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proper orientation of the buildings in the park, planning of shades, warming arrangements, and bringing of other energy-saving elements ensure their energy efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pond of natural sediments and integrated irrigation system will supplement the optimal use of water resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of the park is represented by the minimal interference with the existing landscape and by the systemic situation of new shapes, which gives it special features and meaning.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

&lt;p&gt;From its central location on the Mtkvari Embankment, the site is perfectly placed to capture the unique beauty, historical context and personality of 1500 old capital of Georgia - Tbilisi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;Idea&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of ​​the architectural concept is based on the nature of the local landscape, which envisages the seamless connection to the existing environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The building configuration, proportion and geometry are defined by the existing context and landscape arrangement. It is also expressed in the formation of an architectural context that is reflected in its forms, textures and colors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The design volumes mimic the shape of the hills, which are characteristic for the relief and landscape of the area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposed color scheme will seamlessly merge with the surrounding natural landscape and blend into the existing site. Special consideration is given to all existing plantations on-site to ensure that they are preserved and maintained to full extent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;Content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The multifunctional complex consists of 4 major volumes located on 4 story podiums: a hotel, shopping center, office spaces and 2 living quarters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Shopping Podium (the unifying podium for the whole complex) - is approximately 40-45 000 sq.m. The building comprises of a semi-open construction of 5 floors, with a mega atrium in the center, which is open to the atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The podium fills a large cavity currently formed in the location and repeats and continues the existing contour of the relief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project blends in with the landscape providing an intelligent response to the surrounding environment. It merges culturally and historically with the Old City with a new state of the art sophisticated, but yet moderate building composition.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

&lt;p&gt;The center of the project site of the park is represented by a spruce tree, which has geometric, ideological and functional significance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The system of roots joins the center from all sides of the park. It should be noted, that it is a newly planted coniferous plant, which can be decorated for the Christmas and  New Year or be a centerpiece for other events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a small river flowing down the park, with pedestrian bridges arranged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Access to the park is available from various locations and the whole area, as well as buildings, are adapted for people with disabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Different zones are also presented at Gergeti Park, for example, trade zone, picnic zone, camp zone, administration building and cafeteria with open terrace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The open-air museum (Ethnographic museum with miniature monuments of Kazbegi’s sightseeings) is to be mentioned, which adds special significance to the Gergeti Park.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The facade showcases a sense of simplicity and elegance, with crisp edges and smooth surfaces. These clean lines create a visually pleasing and uncluttered appearance. The building architecture embraces the integration of large windows and abundant natural light. Floor-to-ceiling glass panels allow ample daylight to flood the interior spaces, creating a connection between the inside and outside environments. This emphasis on natural light promotes a sense of well-being and enhances the overall work environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Functions&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have envisioned open floor plans that maximize flexibility and encourage collaboration. Thus, promoting communication, teamwork, and a sense of community among employees. Here, walls and partitions are minimized, creating expansive and adaptable spaces that can be easily reconfigured to accommodate changing needs. The proposed building design embodies sustainability. Green building practices, energy-efficient systems, and environmentally friendly materials are integrated into the design. Features such as solar panels, rainwater harvesting systems, and efficient HVAC systems contribute to reducing the building’s carbon footprint and promoting a healthier work environment.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;The Concept&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fundamental design and concept of the project surpass the typical designation of a luxurious restaurant and its main function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It offers an unparalleled meeting space where people socialize in a magical atmosphere, which lets them escape from hectic city life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The name of the restaurant – Kalaki, in Georgian means “city.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of the space is to create a city within a city with a timeless atmosphere that enables visitors to travel through space, in history and culture and interpret the reality in different lenses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The city inside the city, where time is insignificant, is a place where you can enjoy the magical atmosphere completely distracted from stressful urban routine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s the story told through classic materials, lighting and historical context, which is purposefully imitated in the interior. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sol Omnia Lucet&lt;/em&gt; – the Latin caption at the entrance, translates into &lt;em&gt;sun shines for all&lt;/em&gt;, it sums up the main idea of the project – creating a restaurant, where everybody finds their own individual space to experience time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entire concept of the restaurant and fine dining revolves around the main atrium, the heart of the project, which resembles the typical inner yard of old Tbilisi, residential neighborhoods where inhabitants meet and socialize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;Different Spaces&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Different dining halls are connected via the inner courtyard and offer different dining experiences for various settings and functional gatherings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These planning principles encourage visitors to move around during the evening and explore the space from different perspectives, offering spaces from romantic gateways to casual outdoor seating enables visitors to experience a continuous sense of exploration and excitement at every visit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 100-year-old pine right at the entrance of the building was purposefully maintained to enjoy the natural conditions offered by the location. Now this pine adds a green glow to the facade of the restaurant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Atrium, artificial sky and outdoor facades used indoors to add a certain theatrical nature to space. Giving visitors the feeling of being part of some performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From its food and drinks to the furniture design, this place is designed to awaken feelings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Restaurant offers a truly unique experience combining luxurious European settings and styles with local traditions, it creates an unforgettable experience and leaves memories for visitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Various stories will be born in such a space, we believe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We aimed to create a place in which the meaning of the place would be misinterpreted, yet the place would accept various interpretations of visitors.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;The Concept&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fundamental design and concept of the project surpass the typical designation of a luxurious restaurant and its main function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It offers an unparalleled meeting space where people socialize in a magical atmosphere, which lets them escape from hectic city life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The name of the restaurant – Kalaki, in Georgian means “city.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of the space is to create a city within a city with a timeless atmosphere that enables visitors to travel through space, in history and culture and interpret the reality in different lenses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The city inside the city, where time is insignificant, is a place where you can enjoy the magical atmosphere completely distracted from stressful urban routine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s the story told through classic materials, lighting and historical context, which is purposefully imitated in the interior. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sol Omnia Lucet&lt;/em&gt; – the Latin caption at the entrance, translates into &lt;em&gt;sun shines for all&lt;/em&gt;, it sums up the main idea of the project – creating a restaurant, where everybody finds their own individual space to experience time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entire concept of the restaurant and fine dining revolves around the main atrium, the heart of the project, which resembles the typical inner yard of old Tbilisi, residential neighborhoods where inhabitants meet and socialize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;Different Spaces&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Different dining halls are connected via the inner courtyard and offer different dining experiences for various settings and functional gatherings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These planning principles encourage visitors to move around during the evening and explore the space from different perspectives, offering spaces from romantic gateways to casual outdoor seating enables visitors to experience a continuous sense of exploration and excitement at every visit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 100-year-old pine right at the entrance of the building was purposefully maintained to enjoy the natural conditions offered by the location. Now this pine adds a green glow to the facade of the restaurant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Atrium, artificial sky and outdoor facades used indoors to add a certain theatrical nature to space. Giving visitors the feeling of being part of some performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From its food and drinks to the furniture design, this place is designed to awaken feelings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Restaurant offers a truly unique experience combining luxurious European settings and styles with local traditions, it creates an unforgettable experience and leaves memories for visitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Various stories will be born in such a space, we believe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We aimed to create a place in which the meaning of the place would be misinterpreted, yet the place would accept various interpretations of visitors.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
